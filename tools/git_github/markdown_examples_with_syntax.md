## ✅ Markdown Code Block Examples with Syntax Highlighting

Use these examples to format and present code clearly in `.md` files, especially for GitHub.

---

### 🔹 Inline Code

Use **single backticks** to include code inside a sentence:

Example:

```markdown
Use `git status` to check your working directory.
```

Renders as:

> Use `git status` to check your working directory.

---

### 🔸 Multiline Code Block (Fenced Code Block)

Wrap code in **three backticks**, optionally followed by the language for syntax highlighting.

Example:

Renders as:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
git checkout -b feature/add-form
git add .
git commit -m "Add signup form"
git push origin feature/add-form
```

---

### 🔧 Python Code Example

Renders as:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("CS2 Community")
```

---

### 🌐 HTML Code Example

Renders as:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Welcome</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, CS2 Community!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
