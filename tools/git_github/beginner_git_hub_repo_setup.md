## Beginner Guide: Setting Up a GitHub Repository

## 📦 What is a Git Repository?

A **Git repository** (or *repo*) is a storage space where your project files live, Think of it a as a folder where you track every change you make to your files, allowing you to go back to earlier versions, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of your project.

There are two main types of repositories:

- **Local Repository**: Stored on your own computer; contains your files and a hidden `.git` folder.
- **Remote Repository**: Hosted online (e.g., GitHub) so you can back up and share your work.

A Git repository helps you:
- ✅ Track changes
- ✅ Work in branches
- ✅ Collaborate 

This guide explains the main ways to start a project on GitHub and introduces the role of `.gitignore`.

###  1. Ways to Create a Repository

#### ✅ Option A: Create on GitHub.com

- Easiest way to start a new project
- Auto-generates a README and optional `.gitignore`
- Clone to your computer later

**Steps:**

1. Click the **+** icon in the top right > **New repository**
2. Name your repo and choose visibility (public/private)
3. (Optional) Add README, `.gitignore`, license
4. Click **Create repository**

#### ✅ Option B: Create Locally with Git

- Good for coding offline or starting with existing files
- Create the repo locally, then push to GitHub

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-project.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### ✅ Option C: Fork an Existing Repo

- Use this when contributing to another project
- Creates a copy of someone else's repo under your account

**Steps:**

1. Go to the original repo
2. Click **Fork** (top right)
3. It appears in your GitHub as your own copy
4. Clone it and work on changes

### 📂 What Is a `.gitignore` File?

A `.gitignore` tells Git which files/folders **not to track**.

Example contents:

```bash
# macOS system files
.DS_Store

# Python cache
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# VS Code settings
.vscode/
```

**Why use it?**

- Prevents committing junk or sensitive files
- Keeps repos clean and focused on source code

You can use a [GitHub-provided template](https://github.com/github/gitignore) when creating the repo, or create your own locally.

## Pushing Changes, Branching & Pull Requests

### Push Changes to GitHub

After editing files:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push origin main
```

If you're working on a branch:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

---

### 🌐 Create and Switch to a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature-name
```

Make your changes on this branch. Then push it:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature-name
```

### Open a Pull Request (PR) when Collaborating on Project 
Skip this section if you are working on your own or just learning the basics.


1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button
3. Write a descriptive title and description
4. Click **Create pull request**

###  Open a Pull Request (PR)

1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button
3. Write a descriptive title and description
4. Click **Create pull request**



####  What Does a Pull Request Do?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a formal request to merge changes from one branch (often a feature branch) into another (usually `main`).

- It shows the difference between the two branches.
- Others can **review**, **comment**, or **request changes** before approving.
- Once approved, your work can be safely merged into the main project.

> ✅ Pull Requests help maintain clean, reviewed, and collaborative code — especially in group projects.
